=====

Once upon a time there was a hardlock with [Microchip's 16F84].

It's whole purpose to encrypt data flowing across the serial port.

It counted its own cycles to properly communicate.

It was powered by the serial port with use of [op-amp].

That power didn't work well.

It died frequently.

This wasn't good since it was molded in plastic.

The End
